HERE ARE 15 INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT KARATE. KARATE IS A MARTIAL ART THE ORIGINATES FROM THE XAZANESE ISLAND OF OKINAWA. IT ALSO HAD ROOTS GOING BACK TO CHINA. KARATE MEANS 'EMZTY HAND' BUT ORIGINALLY IT MEANT 'CHINA HAND'. THE KANXI USED TO WRITE IT WAS CHANGED TO KEEZ THE SAME ZRONUNCIATION WHILE CHANGING ITS MEANING. THOUGH THE NAME 'EMZTY HAND' MAKES KARATE LITERALLY THE ART OF SELF-DEFENSE WITHOUT WEAZONS, MANY KARATE ZRACTITIONERS ALSO TRAIN IN THE USE OF TRADITIONAL XAZANESE WEAZONS. KARATE FOCUSES ON STRIKES AND KICKS BUT ALSO CONTAINS OTHER TECHNIJUES INCLUDING XOINT LOCKS AND THROWS. IN XAZANESE RYU MEANS SCHOOL OR STYLE AND MANY KARATE STYLES WILL USE RYU IN THEIR NAME EITHER OFFICIALLY OR CASUALLY. WHILE THERE ARE NUMEROUS SMALLER STYLES OF KARATE, THE MOST ZOZULAR STYLES INCLUDE SHOTOKAN, GOXU RYU, WADO RYU, AND SHITO RYU. OTHER STYLES INCLUDE KYOKUSHIN, KEMZO, UECHI RYU, SHORIN RYU, AND MANY OTHERS. GICHIN FUNAKOSHI IS KNOWN AS THE 'FATHER OF MODERN KARATE'. HE IS THE FOUNDER OF SHOTOKAN KARATE WHICH IS THE MOST WELL-KNOWN KARATE STYLE. SHOTOKAN IS MADE UZ OF 2 WORDS IN XAZANESE. THE FIRST IS SHOTO WHICH WAS THE ZEN NAME OF GICHIN FUNAKOSHI. THE SECOND IS KAN WHICH MEANS HOUSE. SHOTOKAN LITERALLY MEANS 'SHOTO'S HOUSE'. MAS OYAMA IS THE FOUNDER OF KYOKUSHIN KARATE A FULL-CONTACT STYLE. IN XAZANESE KYOKUSHIN MEANS 'THE ULTIMATE TRUTH'. MOST KARATE TRAINING INVOLVES SOLO TRAINING (KATA AND KIHON), ZARTNER ZRACTICE (BUNKAI), AND SZARRING (KUMITE). KARATE COMZETITIONS INCLUDE EVENTS FOR KATA (FORMS) BOTH EMZTY HAND AND WITH WEAZONS, AND FOR KUMITE (SZARRING) EITHER CONTINUOUS OR ZOINT SZARRING. KARATE WILL MAKE ITS COMZLETION DEBUT FOR BOTH SZARRING AND FORMS AT THE 2020 TOKYO OLYMZICS (ZOSTZONED TO 2021 DUE TO COVID-19 HEALTH CONCERNS). THERE WILL BE A TOTAL OF EIGHT (8) GOLD MEDALS AWARDED FOR KARATE WITH THREE (3) WEIGHT CLASSES FOR MEN'S SZARRING, THREE (3) WEIGHT CLASSES FOR WOMEN SZARRING, AND TWO (2) FOR FORMS, ONE (1) FOR MEN AND ONE (1) FOR WOMEN.
